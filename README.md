<p>
  This hack is an innovative approach towards automating a critical part of any Machine Learning problem of model selection from the existing models for the given data. In this Hack I have developed a solution to create an efficient time series model selection algorithm

## Overview

This project was built for the DataGenie Hackathon 2023. This project is my approach to a beautiful problem statement. When a user gives time series data of any frequency, the application must have a ML-powered pre-trained classification algorithm that predicts which Time Series Forecasting model would be the best for the given data without fitting and trying out each time series model on the dataset. Post that we built a time series model to fit the given data which was predicted by the classification model and gave the forecast for the data as well as the MAPE score.
